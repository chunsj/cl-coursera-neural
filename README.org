A partial and minimal porting of the Coursera Machine Learning with Neural
Networks to Common Lisp.  This is not exceptionally polished but there should
always be an attempt to at least confirm the code written here against the
provided Octave code and the [[https://github.com/davidandrzej/py-coursera-neural][Python port]].

I decided not to do a line by line porting of the Octave or Python code to Lisp
because, well that's just not how we Lispers do things.  It is cleaner in its
current form, but harder to prove correct at a glance.  Also, I will be using
some packages that I have been working on but are not officially released, such
as the =zgnuplot= library.  I have been using this plotting library with
in-house code for a long time, but it is still pretty rough around the edges and
the interface is still in flux (hopefully headed towards something a bit
better).  But whatever, it's out there, feel free to do what you will with it.

Note to people that might fork this, the rules on Coursera (well, at least this
course) is that you shouldn't post solutions.  So don't work off this repo, plug
your solution into it, and publish it online.  You should probably work in a
private branch that you don't publish to Github.
